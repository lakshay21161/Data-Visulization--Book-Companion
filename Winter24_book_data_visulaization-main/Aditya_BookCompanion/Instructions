The FlavorDB1.ipynb file contatins all the original/individual codes.

The FlavorDB-combined.ipynb file contatins all the cobined codes, i.e. clickable interface that lets the users choose between multiple graphs/visualisation.

FlavorDB-combined.ipynb contains some more graphs as its options than FlavorDB1.ipynb.

If running the codes that use dash on colab or any other ide, do not use features like run-all i.e. do not run multiple codes(using dash) simultaneously on the same page.

P.S. If you want to run the codes individually using python then please install and import dash in every code that uses it
